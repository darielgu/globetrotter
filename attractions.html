          famous for its dramatic, intricately carved coastal bluffs, arches,
          and sea caves, offering panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean. As its
          name suggests, it's a premier spot for watching spectacular sunsets,
          but also popular for surfing, tide pooling during low tides, whale
          watching during migration seasons, and enjoying leisurely walks along
          its rugged cliffside paths that showcase native coastal sage scrub
          habitat.
