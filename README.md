### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes I felt very prepared by my codepath team for this assignment, I have some previous experience here so I treated class like review.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I will add some more stretch fetaures for my demo but I am submitting like this, finished early

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

First project and everything has gone well, with some previous experience in css and html

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
